# BoardFramework
This is a Library to create 2D Board Games using language **Swift** with SpriteKit. The game [BoardGame](https://github.com/mfdeveloper/BoardGame)
  is a another skeleton example project that use this library to test and validate them! We recommend use the two projects together to understand 
and validate all features!!

This project goals are:

1. Help students and curious to learn concepts about mobile game development to **IOS**
2. Understand Board Game structures
3. Creates mobile games kind of board games in digital version

**OBS:** If the project don't have structures or elements to a board game that you are creating, please create a **#issue**
to the new feature, or fork this project and contribute to us :)

## Future Implementations/Tasks

- [X] Creates a initial Entity to main element(s) of a common and simple board game.
- [ ] Add the **Hand** of a player entity and limit drag in your area
- [ ] Creates a left menu (Like facebook) with actions to board game
- [ ] Define entities to **Rules** of each card or kind of Cards(Characters, Places...)
- [ ] Move the library to a **IOS Swift Framework** to reuse in another board games more easy
- [ ] Add multiplayer initially with between 2 players(bluetooth or web). Search some framework/library that do this to reuse!!
